Single Inheritance 
Class B --> Class A --> Object

Multilevel Inheritance
Class C --> Class B --> Class A --> Object

Heirarchial Inheritance
Class B and Class C inherits from Class A --> Object

Class B & C are subclass and Class A is Parent Class

All the clases in dart Inherits from Object

 Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires properties of parent class objects
Super Class of any class is object
provides default implementation of to string(returns string representation of object), hashCode(getters returns hascode of an object), operator(== to compare two objects)


ADVANTAGES
Code Resusability
Method Overriding
Cleaner Code - No repeatation

Only Child class can Call parent class not vice versa
